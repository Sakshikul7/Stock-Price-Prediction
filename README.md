# Stock-Price-Prediction
Recently, I explored stock price prediction using Python and various data science libraries. Starting with data loading and cleaning using pandas, I focused on key stock features by dropping unnecessary columns.

I visualized the relationships between features using seaborn pair plots and examined the correlations through a heatmap. Additionally, I analyzed the distribution of stock trading volume with a histogram.

To gain insights into stock price trends, I plotted actual closing prices and Prophet predictions for a subset of the data. I then prepared the data for modeling by splitting it into training and testing sets.

Using the XGBoost regression model, I trained and tested the model on the stock data. The model achieved an impressive RÂ² score of 0.999927, indicating highly accurate predictions.

This project not only enhanced my understanding of stock price dynamics but also demonstrated the effectiveness of machine learning models in financial forecasting. Excited to share my journey in leveraging data science to make informed investment decisions!
